Public Sex Index NYC
</h1>
<br><br>

<h4> Catacombs: 6.5/10 </h4>
First time, was for a sex specific party and the goers were hella straight. Was real strange. 
Me and my gf at the time found a great spot, but the vibes were just too weird- that night: 4/10
<br><br>
2nd time, me and my other gf at that time decided to nap before hitting the streets and our nap 
ended up being way longer than we envisoned -later night start for this location means a better 
and gayer crowd-. All we did that night was make out in the combs feeling eachother up, while a 
group of gays coalesced around us in a circle jerk, and we barely even danced cuz the actual 
floor was wacky (what!). 9.5/10 for that. It's rare to feel like a lesbian while being transmasc 
surrounded by cis gays and feel gender euphoria; catching eyes while doing so is even better. 
It also just feels like one of the few spots I can think of non-explicit (as in undesignated so) 
cruise spots in this city where I feel pretty safe.
<br><br>


<h4>A Car Going Uptown From LES: 8/10</h4>
Jumping into a strangers car at night under the guise of popping pu$$y, but actually; you just 
had a long day, you're sleepy, and are trying to avoid that late night commute treachery to the 
heights. I personally love sex in a car, it's the perfect way to feel like you're in public without 
the fear of unconsenually giving someone a show. Anyway I was making out and getting felt up by this 
john for like 40 whole minutes while he drives (I take it back, still being a menace to public safety/sanity). 
Super hot at first, but after a while you remember how far you actually live... and then you run into stupid 
f-ckin robert moses and get lost cuz u forget about his segregational park plans, end up having to drive all 
the way around it and halfway across ur john's like, cant you suck my d-ck if I pull over, while pulling over, 
and ur like- no. But for some reason the compromise he comes up with is giving it a kiss, so you do that, and 
it's back on your merry way and he drops you off a few blocks from your house without paying you and ur like 
man neither of us even came. But you still get your money...weeks later.
<br><br>

<h4>Central Park: 4/10</h4>
Rats. Rats are in the bushes and so are you. But you get to watch the stars while you get f-cked from behind, the wind blows through your hair, 
and you think of your gay ancestors that fucked on this very same ground. But then you snap back out of it and start thinking about the public 
indecency fines or worse- PULL OUT WE GOTTA GO!
Shout out to that strange group of elders that took over part of the park with vibes, smiles, strong ass alcohol, and rave music.
<br><br>

<h4>Riverside: 9/10</h4>
NGL to you, pretty fucking great. Still, the fear though.
<br><br>

<h4>Club Bathrooms: 1.5/10</h4>
I'm no asshole, this only occurs when there are many stalls. It sucks; everyone knows what's happening, everyone wants to do their drugs 
or has to pee and YOU'RE holding up the line. Plus, it's f-cking nasty dude! You got your knees on that damn pee-pee floor? Your hand on 
the stall wall?! No thanks. At least, not for this germ freak. Head is still pretty good though, a classic for sure.

<br><br>
<h4>Soccer Field: 8/10</h4>
Literally why. You're like covered in mud now and everyone's like what the hell.
<br><br>

<h4>Woods: 0/10</h4>
Specifically, this woods that was next to a prison. Middle of the dead of night, pitch black darkness cannot see shit in front of ya. 
Drunk. Somehow, midway, we heard a wolf start howling extremely nearby, and then had the prison alarms started going off in the yard. 
Naked and Afraid? Yea. We ran lmfao.
<br>
There's definitely more, but I don't remember. 
<br><br>

<h4>Rooftop: 10/10</h4>

My ex had this guy from grindr who lived in the building across the way she would text whenever we decided to do this. He’d film us 
from his window and use binoculars. COVID safe 👍

<h1>Sex Shops in the City</h1>
<h3>(the socially accepted form of public sex)</h3>
<br><br>
<h4>Purple Passion/DV8:  NUMBER ONE! Best.</h4>
<br>
PROS:
Most the employees I've met have been trans freak sex workers. Awesome, ideal. They also control the AUX so the music is usually sick.
So much latex and leather items, so many high quality and varied fetish gear types. WITH A FITTING ROOM??? I cannot express to you how 
amazing this is and next level. Where else can you try on latex? Nowhere.
Workers know their stuff, live the life, even make the gear.
Fantastic fliers/leaflets/magazines/newspapers at front free, I wish every store had this.
<br><br>
CONS:
Closes early, like 5pm, so even when I worked just a couple blocks away I'd never make it before they closed for the day.
<br><br>

<h4>The One In Old Little India: Evil, timecapsule</h4>
<br>
PROS:
Weird as f-ck; black and white linoleum tiling like my childhood kitchen, bootleg movies at entryway (a lot of kids movies??), 
All merchandise is like at least 20 years old, so you find some really weird 2000s shit- I got a supercute purse there that 
was the packaging for a lesbian sex set (double ended huge transclucent red dildo that was definitely NOT bodysafe, pink 
bondage tape, nipple clamps, obligatory blindfold).
Has backroom. Is active. I am way to scared to ever go back there.
Has TV on wall across from cashier, it's how I heard Trump was shot.
<br><br>
CONS:
Dude. Horrible. Do not go check out the very back row of DVDs in the p-rno section by the backroom. Not joking, don't.
Everything is covered in dust and grime that is impossible to remove, and lowkey decomposing on the spot.
Terrifying vibe that I enjoy in a fear factor kind of way, but I think because I've been visiting it since highschool 
I feel comfortable there. Maybe I shouldn't though.
<br><br>

<h4>That One In The West Village By Papaya Dog: NOW CLOSED :( </h4>
<br>
I really liked this one, for its epic big red lip signage and trad marquee lighting...You really will be missed, 
alongside all the others leaving us. Never forgotten...
<br><br>
PROS:
Saaaale bin!
VHS p-rno tapes, so epic. Got an amazing fetish one that ended up featuring a pornstar my old exes mom used to work alongside.
Awesome lightbulb marquee sign with big red lips. Just looks fantastic.
<br><br>
CONS:
Besides the tapes and sale box, it's mostly your usual stuff with usual prices.
It's super small.
<br><br>

<h4>Blue Room (? Box?): Gay</h4>
<br>
PROS:
BACKROOM HISTORY! You can find old gay forums with stories of the lower level (that they've now since chained off) where 
they would have huge orgies and wrestling.
Is very much gay focused which is fun.
Oldschool vibe; decent prices, old building/interior
It's really freaking big and has really great and varied selection, unlike the one next door I accidnetally mistook it for (shiny gay..).
Cashier has always been real friendly and jokes.
St-le my first bottle of poppers here (I'm sorry I really regretted it immediately, I was broke), it was one that was already opened by 
someone and I didnt realize they were supposed to be sealed. It leaked all in my bag even though I had it in a plastic bag as well- payback.
<br><br>
CONS:
The cis gay focus kinda made me stick out like a nail at the time.
<br><br>

<h4>Romantic Depot: Chain</h4>
I know it's a chain but I fear it needs to be added still. Each one has a different unique flavor.
<br><br>
PROS:
Crazy cheap price opportunities because they have spin the wheel rewards, rewards cards, a lot of big sales. 
It's why I would shop there occassionally even though I know I shouldn't. 
Very accessible feeling, I think a lot of more "normie" people go here because it feels more welcoming and normal.
Each location has really different decor and vibe depending on the neighborhood.
The workers are all usually very approachable young people from the neighborhood.
Are everywhere.
<br><br>
CONS:
Is a chain.
Basically all the products are cheaply made and trash, just good for last minute needs at low price. 
Kind of the dollar tree of sex shops.
Very straight focused.
<br><br>

<h4>Stripper Shop in Midtown</h4>
<br>
PROS:
I love stores that specialize.
Great place to go to find good quality pleasers and dancewear/costumes.
<br><br>
CONS:
HIGHHH prices.
Very focused on the wear of course, not so much the toys.
Very small.
Has the vibe of a boutique almost.
