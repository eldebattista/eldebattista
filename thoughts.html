                Thought guy was making kissy sounds at me from behind but actually was eating ice cream.

                Kid in souxsie and the banshees shirt beautifully and carefully playing the public piano in west village while people sit on benches and listen.

                <h3> June 20/25 </h3>
                Was “loitering” outside fancy apt building on west side and guy came out to start “leaf blowing the wall I was at.”
                <br><br>  
Old guy across crosswalk from me blowing nose super loud onto sidewalk, misses I guess and gets hand… walks slowly over to the light pole and wipes hand on it multiple times. I never want to touch anything in the city ever again.

                Gay pair on train. One of them is dressed head to toe in black (but pretty average clothing) with a black amulet. He has no or very light arm hair which makes me think his hair is dyed black, 
                and he has a goatee like guy fieri- also black. Can’t really hear what he’s saying to the other except the word death keeps coming up a lot. The other twink is in a red sweater with white pants 
                and shoes, and was talking about podcasts before the other started talking.                <br><br>

                    <h3>June 21/24</h3>
            On a pier that was once a place for gay men to hook up in secret, we climb over a small fence to sit by the water 
            and watch the sunset, while we talk about the sinister evil of USA-backed israel and how terrible it will be if we go to war with Iran.
            We end up getting called by police, not even real police but park safety, and ticketed for trespassing. 
            Person from group rollerblading and skating since we got there rolls over to let us know they meet 
            there every day and never saw anyone ticketed before, just let go with a warning. We were the first. 
            <br>We find out trump just struck Iran three times. (2026 note: I still haven't paid off this ticket...jesus christ).
